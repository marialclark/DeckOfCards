# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Deck of Cards App**

An app that displays a deck of cards, one card at a time. Each time you click the "Draw a Card" button, a new card will display, until there are no cards left in the deck. Client will be informed via an alert when the deck is out of cards, at which point they can shuffle the deck & restart to draw more cards.
